# 🧠 Object-Oriented Programming in Python

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled Class 7.ipynb, which provides a hands-on demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using Python. The notebook is designed to help learners understand how to model real-world entities using classes, objects, methods, and attributes.

## 🚀 Topics Covered

### ✅ Basics of OOP
- What are *Classes, **Objects, and **Attributes*
- Understanding the __init__ constructor
- Defining methods within classes

### 🔄 Four Pillars of OOP
1. *Inheritance* – Reusing code from existing classes
2. *Polymorphism* – Methods behaving differently based on input
3. *Encapsulation* – Hiding internal details of how a class works
4. *Abstraction* – Exposing only essential features

### 📚 Practical Examples
- Creating student objects using a class Students
- Assigning attributes like name, id, education
- Adding behavior with methods such as speaking(), listening(), and eating()
- Comparing procedural vs object-oriented approach
